    "* The number of wins is skewed and looks like a [negative binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_binomial_distribution), which makes sense conceptually\n",
    "* The \"typical\" value here is 1 (both the median and the highest point of the histogram), meaning a typical team that qualifies for the World Cup wins once\n",
    "* There are a few teams we might consider outliers: Belgium and France, with 6x the wins of the \"typical\" team and 1.5x the wins of the next \"runner-up\" (Uruguay, with 4 wins)\n",
